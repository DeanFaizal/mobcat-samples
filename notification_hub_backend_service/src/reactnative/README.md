# React Native push notifications via backend service connected to Azure Notification Hub

## Background

Sample demonstrating the use of Azure Notification Hubs via a backend service to send push notifications to Android and iOS applications.

An ASP.NET Core Web API backend is used to handle device registration on behalf of the client using the latest and best Installation approach via the Notification Hubs SDK for backend operations, as shown in the guidance topic Registering from your app backend.

A cross-platform React Native application is used to demonstrate the use of the backend service using explicit register/deregister actions.

![android app](illustrations/react-native-android-app.png)

If a notification contains an action and is received when app is in the foreground, or where a notification is used to launch the application from notification center, a message is presented identifying the action specified.

Notifications will appear in the notification center when the app is stopped or in the background.

## Create a cross-platform React Native application

In this section, you build a React Native mobile application implementing push notifications in a cross-platform manner.

It enables you to register and deregister from a notification hub via the backend service that you created.

An alert is displayed when an action is specified and the app is in the foreground. Otherwise, notifications appear in notification center.

> [!NOTE]
> You would typically perform the registration (and deregistration) actions during the appropriate point in the application lifecycle (or as part of your first-run experience perhaps) without explicit user register/deregister inputs. However, this example will require explicit user input to allow this functionality to be explored and tested more easily.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- React Native Tools
- For Android, you must have:

  1. Android Studio
  1. A developer unlocked physical device or an emulator (running API 26 and above with Google Play Services installed).

- For iOS, you must have:

  1. Xcode and physical device
  1. An active Apple Developer Account.
  1. A physical iOS device that is registered to your developer account (running iOS 13.0 and above).
  1. A .p12 development certificate installed in your keychain allowing you to run an app on a physical device.

### Create the React Native solution

1. In `Terminal`, update your environment tools, required to work with React Native using the following commands:

```bash
# install node
brew install node
# or update
brew update node
# install wathcman
brew install watchman
# or update
brew upgrade watchman
# install cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

1. In `Terminal`, run the following command, if you have `React Native` CLI installed to uninstall it. You are going to use `npx` to automatically use the latest React Native CLI version available:

```bash
npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> React Native has a built-in command line interface. Rather than install and manage a specific version of the CLI globally, we recommend you access the current version at runtime using `npx`, which ships with Node.js. With `npx react-native <command>`, the current stable version of the CLI will be downloaded and executed at the time the command is run.

1. Navigate to your projects folder where you want to create the new application. Use the Typescript based template by specifying the `--template` parameter:

```bash
# init new project with npx
npx react-native init PushDemo --template react-native-template-typescript

```

1. Run metro server which builds javascript bundles as well as monitors any code updates to refresh it on the fly:

```bash
cd PushDemo
npx react-native start
```

1. Run the iOS app to verify the setup. Make sure you started an iOS simulator or connected an iOS device, before executing the following command:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

1. Run the Android app to verify the setup. This requires a few additional steps in order to configure an Android emulator or device to be able accessing the React Native metro server. The following commands generate initial javascript bundle for Android and put it into the assets folder.

```bash
# create assets folder for the bundle
mkdir android/app/scr/main/assets
# build the bundle
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev true --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
# enable ability for sim to access the localhost
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
```

This script will be pre-deployed with the initial version of the app, where you will be able to configure your emulator or device to access the metro server by specifying the server ip address. Execute the following command to build and run the Android application:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

Once in the app, hit `CMD+M` (emulator) or shake the device to populate the developer settings, navigate to `Settings` > `Change Bundle Location` and specify the metro server ip address with the default port: `<metro-server-ip-address>:8081`.

1. In the `App.tsx` file apply any change to the page layout, safe and make the change is instantly reflected in both iOS and Android apps.
